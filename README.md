🏦 Retail Banking Chatbot using FLAN-T5
This project builds an intelligent customer service chatbot for the Retail Banking sector using a fine-tuned version of Google's FLAN-T5-small large language model.

The chatbot can answer real-world banking queries such as balance checks, card activation, ATM location, loan inquiries, and more. It's trained on a publicly available dataset of prompt–response pairs and deployed using a Gradio web interface for interactive use.
